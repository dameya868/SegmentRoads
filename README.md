Semantic Segmentation of Roads From Satellite Imagery

This repo has the code of two attempts to solve the semantic segmentation of roads from satellite imagery.

First attempt is to train a semantic segmentation network using the AWS sagemaker inbuilt algorithm. 

The second is inspired from skyeyenet and uses a custom trained network to do semantic segmentation of the satellite imagery for road detection.

The results from this model are shared in the notebook itself. It is observed that it does reasonably well with the urban settings.
